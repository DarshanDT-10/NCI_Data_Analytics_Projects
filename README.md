# NCI_Data_Analytics_Projects

This repository provides all the codes of different projects that was implemented as part of my post graduation studies at National College of Ireland.

Folder Descritions:

1.Advanced Data Mining:
Project Title: "Does Topic Modelling Improves Document Classification?"
Developed a project on document classification using topic modelling and supervised learning in order to identify the capability of topic modelling algorithm like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) when used as classifier over supervised machine learning algorithms. Tool used: Jupyter Notebook, RStudio. Team size: 4.

2.Research Project Masters
Project Title: "Paragraph Vector based Sarcasm Detection in Text"
Using python worked on a natural language processing (NLP) project and successfully developed machine learning models which can predicts the given text as sarcastic or not with the help of modules like genism, scikit-learn, numPy, NLTK and pandas. Tool used: Jupyter Notebook. Team size: 1.
